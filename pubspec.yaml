  # Assets
  assets:
    - assets/images/
   # - assets/icons/
   # - assets/fonts/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
 # - family: DM Sans
  #  fonts:
   #   - asset: assets/fonts/DMSans-Regular.ttf
   #   - asset: assets/fonts/DMSans-Medium.ttf
 
 #      weight: 500
    #  - asset: assets/fonts/DMSans-SemiBold.ttf
   #     weight: 600
     # - asset: assets/fonts/DMSans-Bold.ttf
     #   weight: 700
  
  #- family: Inter
  #  fonts:
    #  - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
    #  - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf
     #   weight: 500
     # - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-SemiBold.ttf
     #   weight: 600
     # - asset: assets/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf
     #   weight: 700
